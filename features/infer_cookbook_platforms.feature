Feature: Infer cookbook platforms

In order to remove the need to re-state the platforms that a cookbook supports
As a developer
I want to infer the platforms a cookbook should be tested against from the cookbook metadata

Note that currently this does not implement platform versions.

  Scenario: Supported platforms specified in metadata
    Given a Chef cookbook that defines a set of supported platforms literally in its metadata
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then only the platforms specified in the metadata will be tested against

  Scenario: Supported platforms specified in metadata
    Given a Chef cookbook that defines a set of supported platforms as a wordlist in its metadata
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then only the platforms specified in the metadata wordlist will be tested against

  Scenario: No platforms specified in metadata
    Given a Chef cookbook that does not define a set of supported platforms in its metadata
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then all platforms will be tested against

  Scenario: Unrecognized platform specified as supported
    Given a Chef cookbook that defines several supported platforms, one of which is not recognised
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then a warning will be displayed for the unrecognized platform
      And all recognised platforms will be tested against
