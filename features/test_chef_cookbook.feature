Feature: Integration test Chef cookbook

In order to be able to confirm that my cookbook works on the chosen platforms
As a developer
I want to be able to integration test my Chef cookbook

  Scenario: No Kitchenfile
    Given a Chef cookbook with no integration test configuration
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then the cookbooks default recipe will have been converged successfully
      And the tests will not have been run

  Scenario: Run cookbook integration tests
    Given a Chef cookbook
      And the integration tests are defined in a Kitchenfile included with the cookbook
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then the tests will have been run successfully

  Scenario: Run cookbook integration tests with teardown
    Given a Chef cookbook with no integration test configuration
     When I run the integration tests twice with test kitchen with teardown
     Then the cookbooks default recipe will have been converged successfully
      And the node will have been torn down between runs

  Scenario: Run cookbook integration tests without teardown
    Given a Chef cookbook with no integration test configuration
     When I run the integration tests twice with test kitchen without teardown
     Then the cookbooks default recipe will have been converged successfully
      And no node will have been torn down between runs

  Scenario: Malformed Kitchenfile
    Given a Chef cookbook
      And the integration tests are defined in a malformed Kitchenfile included with the project
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then an error indicating that there is a problem with the configuration will be shown
      And the tests will not have been run

  Scenario: Cookbook has correctness problems
    Given a Chef cookbook that would fail a lint tool correctness check
      And the integration tests are defined in a Kitchenfile included with the cookbook
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then an error indicating that there is a correctness problem with the cookbook will be shown
      And the tests will not have been run

  Scenario: Cookbook has style problems
    Given a Chef cookbook that would be flagged as having only style warnings by the lint tool
      And the integration tests are defined in a Kitchenfile included with the cookbook
     When I run the integration tests with test kitchen
     Then an error indicating that there is a correctness problem with the cookbook will not be shown
      And the tests will have been run
